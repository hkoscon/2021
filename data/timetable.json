The topics will be about how we arrange study jams, how we run workshops, how we build a team to attend competitions, how we connect companies to become a league, and the most important, how we grow the community and the lesson learned.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n","venue":{"name":"Room 1","weight":0},"language":"English","language_sym_interp":[],"level":"Beginner","speakers":[{"name":"Shengyou Fan","community":"JetBrains","country":"Taiwan","description":"\u003Cp\u003EShengyou is Developer Advocate at JetBrains.
